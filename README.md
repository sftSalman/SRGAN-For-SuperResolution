# SRGAN-For-SuperResulation
SRGAN (Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network) for Super-Resolution
## Overview
SRGAN is a deep learning architecture designed for image super-resolution, specifically the task of generating high-resolution images from low-resolution inputs. It combines the power of generative adversarial networks (GANs) and deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to produce visually appealing and detailed images.

## How SRGAN Works
SRGAN consists of a generator network and a discriminator network. The generator network takes a low-resolution image and produces a corresponding high-resolution image using deep CNNs. By leveraging features from multiple layers, it enhances the details and sharpness of the generated image. The discriminator network acts as a critic, distinguishing between real and generated high-resolution images, providing feedback to improve the generator's output quality.
